                    When i first came to University, I had no idea how to code and thought to be impossible for me
                    to learn how to code.
                    It was a big struggle to understand how to code and how I can implement what I have learnt in
                    the lessons into
                    my actual coding for assignments and exams. It was because of the good lectures that teach at
                    the University of Northampton
                    that guided me and helped me learn and understand how to implement the code i learnt into my
                    assignments and exams. The two
                    lecturers that stood out the most has been Mark Johnson (Software Engineering CSY1019) and Chris
                    Rafferty (Web Development CSY1018).
                    They taught me to be patient, calm, and persistent because they knew that this course in
                    particular can be frustrating with
                    code not working or things not planning out the right way. Chris helped me especially with this
                    assignment, gearing me with the knowledge
                    and the mindset I have to have while taking on coding. For example sometimes when validating the
                    code, there was an error to the code that I didnâ€™t immediately know how to solve. Instead
                    getting frustrated at the code, I look at different alternative code that can produce the same
                    effect and not be counted as an error. When I found that worked, I was able to implement this
                    way of thinking into the rest of my coding. The important things I learnt while doing this
                    assignment was how to use HTML,
                    how to use HTML tags, how to use CSS effectively and how to link CSS and HTML together. So far I
                    will say my skills and my current development
                    is 7.5/10.

                    There were some problems and challenges in order to make the code work. The images below show this-
