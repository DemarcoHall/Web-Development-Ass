                        When i first came to University, I had no idea how to code and thought to be impossible for me to learn how to code.
                        It was a big struggle to understand how to code and how I can implement what I have learnt in the lessons into
                        my actual coding for assignments and exams. It was because of the good lectures that teach at the University of Northampton
                        that guided me and helped me learn and understand how to implement the code i learnt into my assignments and exams. The two 
                        lecturers that stood out the most has been Mark Johnson (Software Engineering CSY1019) and Chris Rafferty (Web Development CSY1018).
                        They taught me to be patient, calm, and persistant because they knew that this course in particular can be frustrating with 
                        code not working or things not planning out the right way. Chris helped me especially with this assignment, gearing me with the knowledge
                        and the mindset I have to have while taking on coding. The important things I learnt while doing this assignment was how to use HTML,
                        how to use HTML tags, how to use CSS effectively and how to link CSS and HTML together. So far I will say my skills and my current development
                        is 7.5/10.
